# jUnit-Manual-Tests
This repo includes the manual tests I wrote in jUnit for a project. The entire project is not included because it is copyrighted course material.

This project is a basic coffee making java program. My task was to write unit tests for a faulty version of this project. My tests were able to catch all faults within the project.
